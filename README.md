## About
This is a Windows 7 gadget to monitor how much dogecoins you have and the current price of that total. In the addresses.csv place your wallet public addresses
(remove the example addresses that are in there with your own. These are not my addresses, they are random addresses I picked from dogechain.info to show as an example).
Then install the gadget and every 5 seconds the total amount of dogecoins you have along with there current market value will be updated on the gadget.
